# This script outputs information about the current user and about the current system such as:
# Welcome message with user name, current host, date and time of last login (before current one),
# amount of local and environment variables defined, directories in search path, current 
# 1-minute load average, how long system has been up and information about current filesystem.
# 

# Script exits if LOGNAME or PATH are empty and output an error message.

# Prints message with name or login if name is not defined.
